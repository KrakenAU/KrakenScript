## 🌠 Overview

KrakenScript is a celestial journey into the realm of programming languages. This cosmic endeavor aims to create a simple yet expandable language, serving as a launchpad for learning and innovation in language design.

## 🛰️ Mission Objectives

- 🌍 Establish a basic, functional programming language as our home base
- 🌌 Design a modular architecture for seamless expansion into new frontiers
- 🔭 Maintain stellar coding standards and crystal-clear readability
- 🚀 Serve as a cosmic academy for aspiring language designers

## 🌠 Constellation of Features (Planned)

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Basic syntax and structure | 🌕 |
| Variable declaration and assignment | 🌘 |
| Basic arithmetic operations | 🌘 |
| Conditional statements | 🌘 |
| Loops | 🌘 |
| Functions | 🌘 |
| Modular design for easy feature addition | 🌘 |

*Legend: 🌕 Implemented | 🌘 Planned*
