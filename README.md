# 🚀 KrakenScript

Welcome to KrakenScript, my personal programming language project! I'm creating KrakenScript as an exciting journey into language design and implementation.

⚠️ **KrakenScript is a new and experimental language.** It's currently in early development and may not work as expected. Features, syntax, and functionality are subject to change. **Don't use it for anything important yet**.

## 🌠 What's KrakenScript?

KrakenScript is my attempt at crafting a programming language that's:

- 🎨 Elegant yet powerful
- 🧠 Intuitive to learn
- 🛰️ Fun to explore

It's inspired by my favorite features from various languages, with a dash of personal flair!

## 🌌 Sneak Peek

Here's a glimpse of what KrakenScript code looks like:

```
func main()
    greet("Coder")
    
    if is_coffee_needed()
        print("Alert: Low energy detected! Brew coffee!")
    else
        print("All systems go. Keep coding!")
```

## 🛠️ Project Status

KrakenScript is currently in its initial development phase. I'm actively working on the language spec and a basic compiler. Here's my roadmap:

- [x] Basic syntax design
- [x] Variable declarations
- [x] Function definitions
- [x] Conditional statements
- [ ] Loops
- [ ] Data structures
- [ ] Standard library
- [ ] Compiler

## 📚 Documentation

Check out the [Syntax Guide](SYNTAX.md) to explore KrakenScript's current design in detail.

## 🤝 Feedback

While this is a personal project, I'm always open to ideas and feedback! Feel free to open an issue if you have suggestions or spot any bugs in the documentation.

## 🌟 Why KrakenScript?

Why not? 😄 I've always been fascinated by programming languages, and creating one seemed like the perfect way to expand my understanding of language design, parsers, and compilers. The name? Well, I just think krakens are cool!
