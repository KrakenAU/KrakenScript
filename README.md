## :ocean: Overview

KrakenScript is a mesmerizing, ocean-inspired programming language that wraps its tentacles around your imagination. Designed for adventurous developers ready to plunge into the depths of creative coding, KrakenScript transforms the art of programming into an exhilarating underwater expedition.

## 🦑 Key Features

- 🐙 **Tentacle-based Syntax**: Craft elegant code structures with the graceful `~`
- 🖋️ **Ink Functions**: Unleash powerful functions with the mystical `@ink`
- 💬 **Bubble Comments**: Encapsulate your thoughts in ethereal `(* *)` bubbles or swift `//` currents
- 🌊 **Ocean-themed Data Types**: Harness the power of the sea with unique data structures
- 🧠 **Intuitive and Expressive**: Write code that flows as naturally as ocean currents

## 🐚 Quick Start

Immerse yourself in the world of KrakenScript:

```
// Summon the creatures of the deep
@ink summon(creature: String) ~
    print("From the abyss, {{creature}} emerges!");
~

@ink main() ~
    let depth = 20000  (* leagues under the sea *)
    let legendary_beings = ["Kraken", "Leviathan", "Hydra"]
    
    for being in legendary_beings ~
        summon(being)  // Call the summon function for each being
    ~
    
    // Reveal the depth of our journey
    print("At {{depth}} leagues, the ocean's secrets unfold!")
~
```
## 🌿 Usage

KrakenScript is still gestating in its abyssal egg. Prepare for its emergence - usage instructions are on the horizon!

## 🐠 Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is under construction. In the meantime, explore the `examples/` folder to uncover the mysteries of KrakenScript.

For an immersive guide to KrakenScript's syntax and features, dive into our [Syntax Guide](docs/SYNTAX.md). It illuminates everything from basic tentacle structures to advanced ink manipulation techniques.

## 🐳 Contributing

KrakenScript is primarily a solo voyage through the depths of coding, but fellow seafarers are welcome to signal from their ships! While the Kraken steers its own course, your ideas can be like guiding stars:

- Cast your message in a bottle (open an issue) for bug reports or feature ideas.
- Offer a treasure map (documentation improvements) to help others navigate these waters.
- Share tales of your KrakenScript adventures (examples and use cases) to inspire fellow coders.

Before diving in, consult our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to understand how you can safely approach the Kraken and contribute to its journey.

Remember, while the Kraken appreciates the company, it swims alone in the vast ocean of code development.
